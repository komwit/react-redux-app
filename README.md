# Create React-Redux-Electron-Aframe App

Here I create a basic web application using :

* Javascript
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
* [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)

I guide you through:

* setup [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor
* setup [linter-xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
* setup an application with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* setup a demo on [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)
* create a react component
* setup routing with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* setup Redux store, actions and reducers
* connect React and Redux
* perform an AJAX call in Redux environment (with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios))
* setup Electron to work with React and Redux
* add a A-Frame component
* build the app for both web and desktop*
* display a 3D view with A-Frame

(\*for now on windows only)
