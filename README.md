# Create React-Redux-Electron App

Here I create a basic web application using :

* Javascript
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

I guide you through:

* setup [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor
* setup [linter-xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
* setup an application with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* create a react component
* setup routing with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* setup Redux store, actions and reducers
* connect React and Redux
* perform an AJAX call in Redux environment (with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios))
* setup Electron to work with React and Redux

See the step by step tutorial [here](https://github.com/mhebrard/react-redux-app/wiki)
Thanks to Flavio Copes' [post](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-create-react-app-electron/) for the integration with electron.
